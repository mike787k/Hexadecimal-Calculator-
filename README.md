Used ReactJS to develop a functional Hexadecimal Calculator

Each functional button is separated and classified based on their different given values; IE: numeric, operators, or alphabets

A display bar is also presented where the user can see the current state of the calculator
Within the display bar, it updates the user the values of the buttons they pressed
