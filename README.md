***DISCLAIMER PLEASE DO NOT COPY THE FOLLOWING SOLUTIONS AND CODES/FILES; THIS WAS MADE FOR A SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT/PROJECT THANK YOU!***

Used ReactJS to create a Hexadecimal Calculator; the buttons for 0 through F, +, -, *, /, = and a clear button are also made.

A display bar is also presented where the user can see the current state of the calculator

Within the display bar, it shows the user the values of the buttons they pressed so if the user inputs 2 + 2 then in the display bar it displays the total
amount which would be 4
